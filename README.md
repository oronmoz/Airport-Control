# Flight Management System

## Description

This project implements a simple flight management system in C++. It includes classes for managing flight companies, crew members, flight information, planes, and addresses. The system demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, constructors, destructors, and basic operations on flight-related data.

## Classes

- `CAddress`: Manages address information
- `CCrewMember`: Represents a crew member with personal details
- `CFlightCompany`: Represents an airline company
- `CFlightInfo`: Contains information about a specific flight
- `CPlane`: Represents an aircraft

## Features

- Create and manage flight companies
- Add and update crew member information
- Handle flight details including destination, duration, and distance
- Manage plane information
- Perform basic operations like updating flight times and comparing objects

## Usage

The `main()` function in the provided code demonstrates the usage of various classes and their methods. You can modify this function or create your own to test different scenarios and operations within the flight management system.
